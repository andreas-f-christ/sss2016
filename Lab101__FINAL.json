The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result to be returned to the driver program. This design enables Spark to run more efficiently – for example, we can realize that a dataset created through map will be used in a reduce and return only the result of the reduce to the driver, rather than the larger mapped dataset.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<p>By default, each transformed RDD may be recomputed each time you run an action on it.
